GARMIN upload/download utilities for the Garmin GPS 12, 12XL, 48, III, and
III+ units.  These compile/work on OpenBSD and Linux.  They may compile/work
on other *BSD based systems.  All original code is placed in the Public Domain
by its author, Marco S Hyman.

GNUmakefiles and Linux support was added by Vladislav Zavjalov,
<sla@zav.mccme.ru>.  Grigory Pupkov, <pupkov@mccme.ru> added code
for a Y2K fix and support for the different waypoint data found
in the Garmin GPS 12/12XL/48 devices. They hold the copyrights on their
changes.

The "Y2K fix" is to change the format of the timestamp in tracklogs
from "yymmddhhmss" to "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss". A script, fixtrack,
is included to transform existing track logs to the new format.

To install (BSD):

 1) Look at Makefile.inc in this directory.  This is where install locations
    and default serial port may be modified.  Linux/BSD selection may be
    modified here, too.

 2) make depend && make
    This generates libgarmin and the gardump and garload utilities

 3) make install
    this installs the upload/download utilities as well as their man
    pages.  You may need root access to perform this step.

To install (Linux)

 1) Edit GNUmakefile.inc in this directory.   This is where
    install locations and the default serial port may be modified.
    Linux/BSD selection may be modified here, too.

 2) make
    This generates libgarmin and the gardump and garload utilities

 3) Copy binaries and manpages to their locations.

See the man pages for instructions on use.  Unless changed in step 1,
both programs look for "/dev/gps".   Create a symbolic link named
/dev/gps pointing to the serial port connected to your gps, e.g.
/dev/cua00.

Questions/comments/bitches to marc@snafu.org.  Note: these do what
I want them to do.  Grigory and Vladislav added code to make it do
what they wanted.   If the programs don't do what you want start
writing code :-)   If you feed the patches back to me I'll most
likely fold them back in and create a new release.

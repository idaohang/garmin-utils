*****
THE DATA FORMAT OF THIS VERSION IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH VERSIONS PRIOR TO 1.91.
You will not be able to upload data saved with previous versions of the
software.   The easiest way to convert the data formats is to upload using
an older version of the software then download using this version.
*****

GARMIN upload/download utilities for the Garmin GPS 12, 12XL, 48, III, and
III+ units.  Starting with version 1.9 the eMap, eTrex, V and other modern
units are supported.

These utilities compile/work on OpenBSD, NetBSD 1.6.1/i386 and Linux.
The code will not compile with egcs-2.91.66, such as found on NetBSD
1.5.4_ALPHA.  They may compile/work on other *BSD based systems.  All
original code is placed in the Public Domain by its author, Marco S
Hyman.

GNUmakefiles and Linux support was added by Vladislav Zavjalov,
<sla@zav.mccme.ru>.  Grigory Pupkov, <pupkov@mccme.ru> added code
for a Y2K fix and support for the different waypoint data found
in the Garmin GPS 12/12XL/48 devices. They hold the copyrights on their
changes.


To install (BSD):

 1) Look at Makefile.inc in this directory.  This is where install locations
    and default serial port may be modified.  Or, on BSD, set
    GPS_SERIAL_PORT in /etc/mk.conf.  Linux/BSD selection may be
    modified here, too.

 2) make depend && make
    This generates libgarmin and the gardump and garload utilities

 3) make install
    this installs the upload/download utilities as well as their man
    pages.  You may need root access to perform this step.

To install (Linux)

 1) Edit GNUmakefile.inc in this directory.   This is where
    install locations and the default serial port may be modified.
    Linux/BSD selection may be modified here, too.

 2) make
    This generates libgarmin and the gardump and garload utilities

 3) Copy binaries and man pages to their locations.

 The code assumes that Linux does not have strlcpy, so the bsd version
 is included in libgarmin.   If your version of Linux has strlcpy remove
 references to strlcpy.o from lib/GNUmakefile and lib/gpslib.h.

See the man pages for instructions on use.  Unless changed in step 1,
both programs look for "/dev/tty00" (BSD) or "/dev/gps" (Linux).

Questions/comments/bitches to marc@snafu.org.  Note: these do what
I want them to do.  Grigory and Vladislav added code to make it do
what they wanted.   If the programs don't do what you want start
writing code :-)   If you feed the patches back to me I'll most
likely fold them back in and create a new release.
